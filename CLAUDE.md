# Cartographyr

Persistent geographic foundation mod for a modular Minecraft project (Minecraft Java Edition). Part of a suite of intercommunicating mods that expose public APIs so other mods — the user's own and third parties' — can integrate.

## Context directory — read this first

Before searching source for architecture, ownership boundaries, API shape, or "why does this work this way," check `context/` first. It's maintained specifically to answer those questions cheaply:

- `context/design-document.md` — the authoritative design spec: architecture, entity model, full public API surface, storage design, implementation phases, testing strategy. Start here for anything about intended shape or scope.
- `context/decisions.md` — dated log of decisions made during implementation that extend or override the design document, with rationale. Check this for anything that looks like it contradicts design-document.md — the doc should already reflect the current decision, but this explains why.
- `context/classes/` — one short markdown file per implemented class: public surface, key state, collaborators. Read the relevant file here before opening the actual source, and before editing a class update its file to match.

**Keep this system current as you work:**
- When a design decision is made that conflicts with or is absent from design-document.md, update design-document.md directly and add a dated entry to decisions.md explaining the change.
- When a class is added or its public surface changes, add or update its file in `context/classes/`.
- Don't let source and these docs drift — treat updating them as part of finishing the change, not optional cleanup.

## Status

Phase 0 (Version/Loader Lock) — decided 2026-09-23, see [context/decisions.md](context/decisions.md):
- Loader: **NeoForge**
- Minecraft version: **26.1.2**
- Java: **JDK 25** (standalone Eclipse Temurin, JAVA_HOME set)
- Group ID: `com.github.cerealklla.cartographyr` / Mod ID: `cartographyr`

Gradle project scaffolded from the official NeoForge MDK (ModDevGradle plugin). Minimal `CartographyrMod` / `CartographyrModClient` entry points in place, no example content. First `gradlew build` run to verify the toolchain — check its result before assuming the build is green.

Next: Phase 1 (Core Data Model) per design-document.md Section 12.
